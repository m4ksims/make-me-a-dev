# Active Developer badge with ease!

With this tool, you can receive the Active Developer badge with ease with no programming knowledge!

# Requirements
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads) [3.8+]
* [Discord](https://www.discord.com) server that is owned by you
* [Discord Bot](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

# Usage
Once you install all the requirements and invite the bot to your discord server, you will need to do the following things:

1. Head over to the folder you have installed from github and type in `cmd` in the search bar

2. Head over to the file `token.txt` and insert your bot's token exactly as it is written. If you are not sure how to get your bot's token, look in the screenshot below:

4. Once opened, run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` and after all NextCord libraries are installed, run the command `python bot.py`; the command will start your bot and allow you to interact with it in your Discord server.

Once the bot has started, you will need to run the command `/badge` in the Discord server you have created. If successful, you will be greeted with a message from the bot.
